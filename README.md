## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/krishnaperumalla/Real-Time-Entertainment-Website.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Real-Time-Entertainment-Website
    ```

3.  **Run with a local server:**
    Because the project uses root-relative paths (e.g., `/css/styles.css`), you need to serve the files from a local web server. Opening the `index.html` file directly in the browser will result in broken links.

    A simple way to do this is by using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for Visual Studio Code. Once installed, right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

##  usage

1.  When you first visit the site, you will land on the `index.html` page.
2.  Click the "Get Started" or "SIGN UP" button to navigate to the login/signup flow. (Note: The current implementation simulates login using `localStorage`).
3.  Once "logged in," you will be redirected to `home.html`, the main dashboard.
4.  Use the navigation bar on the left (or bottom on mobile) to switch between Home, Movies, Series, Anime, and Franchises.
5.  Use the search bar at the top to find specific titles.
6.  Click on the user icon to visit your `profile.html` page and manage your account.
